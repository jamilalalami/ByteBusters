Project Description:
Our project, "ClearBreath UAE," stands at the intersection of public health and environmental sustainability, squarely addressing the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goalsâ€”SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being) and SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities). Utilizing a rich dataset of PM10 sensor readings from across the UAE, provided by the Ministry of Climate Change and Environment, we harness TensorFlow-powered machine learning algorithms to unravel the patterns of particulate matter pollution in residential areas.
Purpose and Relation to UN SDGs:
The initiative is committed to:
1.	Advancing Public Health (SDG 3): By analyzing localized PM10 data, we aim to shed light on air quality dynamics that directly impact respiratory health, guiding interventions to safeguard community health.
2.	Promoting Sustainable Urban Environments (SDG 11): The insights derived from our analysis are instrumental for urban planners and environmental authorities in strategizing effective pollution reduction, contributing to the overarching goal of sustainable urbanization.
Technical Overview:
Our approach employs TensorFlow to build a predictive model that integrates time-series data from fixed-site sensors with geospatial information. This model encapsulates convolutional layers to process spatial attributes and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) layers to effectively capture temporal dependencies and fluctuations in PM10 levels. The outcome is a robust tool capable of forecasting air quality, identifying long-term trends, and informing policy decisions with a high degree of accuracy.
